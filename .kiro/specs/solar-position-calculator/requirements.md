# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a .NET desktop application that provides astronomical calculations and visualizations for solar positioning. The application will calculate the sun's position in the sky based on geographic coordinates and time, while also illustrating the equation of time - the difference between apparent solar time and mean solar time throughout the year. This tool will be valuable for astronomers, photographers, solar energy professionals, and anyone interested in understanding solar mechanics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input my geographic location (latitude and longitude) and a specific date/time, so that I can calculate the exact position of the sun in the sky at that moment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters latitude coordinates THEN the system SHALL accept values between -90 and +90 degrees
2. WHEN the user enters longitude coordinates THEN the system SHALL accept values between -180 and +180 degrees
3. WHEN the user selects a date and time THEN the system SHALL calculate the sun's azimuth angle (compass direction)
4. WHEN the user selects a date and time THEN the system SHALL calculate the sun's elevation angle (height above horizon)
5. IF the calculated elevation is negative THEN the system SHALL indicate that the sun is below the horizon

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a graphical representation of the equation of time throughout the year, so that I can understand how solar time varies from clock time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a graph showing the equation of time curve for the entire year
2. WHEN displaying the equation of time THEN the system SHALL show values ranging from approximately -16 to +14 minutes
3. WHEN the user hovers over the graph THEN the system SHALL display the exact equation of time value for that date
4. WHEN the user clicks on a point on the graph THEN the system SHALL update the date input to that selected date

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to visualize the sun's path across the sky for my location, so that I can understand solar movement patterns throughout the day and year.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests a sun path diagram THEN the system SHALL display a sky dome or polar projection
2. WHEN displaying the sun path THEN the system SHALL show the current sun position as a highlighted point
3. WHEN displaying the sun path THEN the system SHALL show the complete daily arc for the selected date
4. WHEN the user changes the date THEN the system SHALL update the sun path to reflect seasonal variations
5. IF the location is in polar regions THEN the system SHALL handle midnight sun and polar night conditions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time solar calculations that update automatically, so that I can track the sun's movement throughout the day.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enables real-time mode THEN the system SHALL update calculations every minute using the current system time
2. WHEN in real-time mode THEN the system SHALL continuously update the sun position display
3. WHEN the user disables real-time mode THEN the system SHALL return to manual date/time input
4. WHEN in real-time mode THEN the system SHALL display the current local time and UTC time

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export solar data and visualizations, so that I can use the information in other applications or share it with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests data export THEN the system SHALL provide solar position data in CSV format
2. WHEN the user requests image export THEN the system SHALL save visualizations as PNG or SVG files
3. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include timestamp, coordinates, azimuth, elevation, and equation of time values
4. WHEN exporting for a date range THEN the system SHALL generate data points at user-specified intervals

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle different coordinate systems and time zones, so that I can work with various geographic and temporal references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters coordinates THEN the system SHALL accept both decimal degrees and degrees/minutes/seconds formats
2. WHEN the user selects a location THEN the system SHALL automatically determine the appropriate time zone
3. WHEN displaying times THEN the system SHALL show both local time and UTC
4. WHEN calculating solar positions THEN the system SHALL account for daylight saving time transitions
5. IF the user manually overrides the time zone THEN the system SHALL use the specified time zone for calculations
